# QuizLoop
When I learn a new programming language, I easily forget the others I’ve learned before. So, I want to create a website that offers quizzes to help me review what I’ve already learned in each language. There will be three types of quizzes: a short one that lasts about 2–3 minutes, a normal one that takes 5–10 minutes, and a longer, more in-depth quiz for testing deeper knowledge. 

- If I get a question wrong, it will appear again later in a different form to help reinforce my understanding.
- If I get a question right and quicly, it will appear less during the course of the quizz.

There will be tags for each question to be able to pick the topic of the quizz.
